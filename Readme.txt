Diffusion Weighted Image Analysis Using Machine Learning
This project analyzes Diffusion-Weighted MRI (DWI) images to classify normal and ischemic stroke cases using machine learning. Images are preprocessed with OpenCV (grayscale conversion, resizing, normalization) and key features like mean pixel intensity, Sobel gradients, and fractal dimension are extracted.

Technologies Used:
Python â€“ Core implementation

OpenCV â€“ Image preprocessing

Scikit-Learn â€“ Machine learning models (Logistic Regression, SVM, Random Forest, KNN)

Matplotlib & Seaborn â€“ Data visualization (histograms, box plots, ROC curves)

PCA & t-SNE â€“ Dimensionality reduction for visualization

AI/ML Integration:
âœ… Machine Learning models are trained to classify stroke vs. normal images.
âœ… Performance metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix assess model effectiveness.

ðŸ”¹ Outcome: This project provides an AI-driven approach for analyzing stroke MRI images, aiding in medical diagnosis. ðŸš€
